# JoustusEngine

This project is an attempt at building a reusable and developer-friendly engine for running games of Joustus. My hope is that when/if it's successfully created, it will encourage other devs to build full applications with it such as an online multiplayer version or other single-player campaigns. This is my first attempt at a project like this, so I may make poor decisions here and there. Any feedback, critique, advice, or pull requests are welcome!
